# Decrypting-Encrypted-Messages-with-Linux
This project demonstrates how to use Linux command-line tools and cryptographic techniques to uncover hidden messages in encrypted files. The activity simulates a real-world scenario where files in a userâ€™s home directory have been encrypted, and you must recover them by identifying and breaking a Caesar cipher, then decrypting with OpenSSL.
